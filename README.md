# Interactive Restaurant Chatbot

This project is an intelligent **NLP chatbot** designed for a restaurant ordering system, developed using **Dialogflow**, **Python (FastAPI)**, and a **MySQL database**. It supports both front-end interaction via a web interface and back-end operations for managing orders, intents, and entities. The following README provides detailed instructions for setting up and running the project.

## Directory Structure

```
backend/           # Contains Python FastAPI backend code
db/                # Database dump (import this into your MySQL database using MySQL Workbench)
dialogflow_assets/ # Training phrases, intents, and entities for Dialogflow
frontend/          # Website code
```

---

## Installation Instructions

### Install Required Python Modules
Use either of the following options:

- Install modules individually:
  ```bash
  pip install mysql-connector
  pip install "fastapi[all]"
  ```

- Install all dependencies at once using the requirements file:
  ```bash
  pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
  ```

### Database Setup
1. Open **MySQL Workbench**.  
2. Import the database dump located in the `db/` folder.

## Starting the FastAPI Backend Server

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

   The server will be accessible at:  
   `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

## Setting Up HTTPS Tunneling with Ngrok

1. Download and install **Ngrok**:
   - Visit [Ngrok's official website](https://ngrok.com/download) and download the version compatible with your operating system.  
   - Extract the downloaded zip file and place `ngrok.exe` (or the equivalent binary) into a folder of your choice.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder containing the Ngrok executable, and run:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 8000
   ```

   This will generate a public HTTPS URL for your FastAPI server, which can be used for testing with Dialogflow.

   **Note:** Ngrok sessions may expire. Restart the session if you encounter a timeout or expiration message.

## Notes

- Ensure that your Dialogflow project is configured to use the correct webhook URL generated by Ngrok.  
- Modify the `backend` code if needed to match database credentials or other environment-specific settings.
